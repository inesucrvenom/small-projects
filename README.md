## git diff analyser
November 2020
tech: pandas, jupyter notebook, gvim, git diff, exiftool

Use case:
- there are around 10000 photos in two folders, 'oglasi' and 'arhiva'
- 'arhiva' is used to basically be backup, but was maintained manually, which includes renaming files
- filenames have croatian characters, dots, commas

problem: figure out which pictures between the two folders are:
- missing in one of them
- just renamed
- modified in some way, and which

In order to have a single source of truth.
