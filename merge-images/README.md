## 2010 merge_slika.sh
Digitalisation of a magazine for my mother, when you don't have a scanner and pages won't lie flat.

Images were edited with various contrast/brightness, in order to get parts that were usable.
Then this merging tool was used to grab and merge those usable parts so that end product is completely readable.

It worked. Don't ask me now for details, I have no clue nor did only a few years after I've made it. This one is mine 'aaaa that's the purpose of the documentation and comments'. Even though it has some, it definitely lacks information about preparation of images.
